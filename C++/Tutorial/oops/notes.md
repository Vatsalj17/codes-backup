# OOP

## Pillars of oops
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Encapsulation
It is wrapping up of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

### Constructor
Special method invoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for Initialisation.
#### Properties of const.
- Same name as class
- It doesn't have a return type
- Only called once (automatically), at object creation
- Memory allcoation happens when constructor is called

### Inheritance
When properties and member function of base class is passed on to the derived class.

### Polymorphism
It is ablity of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used.
Eg. Constructor Overloading

### Abstraction
Hiding all unnecessary details & showing only the important parts.
